# Smart-Home-Automation-Control-System (Senior Project)

## Synopsis
The goal of this control system is to be able to access and control everyday home
appliances without actually having to get up and turn them on and off etc. The
way to accomplish this feat is through a touch screen device that will control the
inputs of the whole system. These inputs will then be sent, wirelessly, to the
appliance control part of the system that will select the proper appliance and
control it, based on the input commands that it was given.
